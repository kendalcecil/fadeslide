        <h2>Pittsburgh,PA</h2>
        <img src="grey.jpg" alt="grey sky with rainbow">
        <p>I was raised in Pittsburgh Pennslyvania from 1st grade through my early 20's. Fun-fact: It's named one of the top 10 cloudiest cities in America.</p>

        <h2>West Virginia</h2>
        <img src="flatwoods.jpg" alt="home of the green monster">
        <p>Country roads, take me home! It's easy to fall in love with West Virgina; filled with funny monster themed tourist traps, to old American history throughout the streets. It's by far some of the most relaxing vacations I've ever taken.</p>

        <h2>Colorado</h2>
        <img src="mountain.jpg" alt="colorado">
        <p>My most recent adventure! I've never gotten to be so high up in the mountians before. I feel so lucky to have been able to explore and see the sites, I'd love to go back and see even more one day.</p>

        <h2>Alabama</h2>
        <img src="al.jpg" alt="really cool bird I saw once on a hike">
        <p>My current residency! I love Huntsville and all the beauty that comes with it. Moving 700 miles was one of the best choices I've made to date. I hope to continue to travel and move around in the future.</p>
